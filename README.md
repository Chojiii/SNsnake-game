# SNsnake-game
This is my second project using c#. i made a snake game because that was one of the things i could make with my current understanding of c#. I chose to make this because this was one of the games i enjoyed paying when i was a kid. I always wondered how people make things like that and it was  one of the things that got me interested in programming. Anyways, i hope you like it. Enjoy!
